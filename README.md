# ElementorPro-Posts-Shortcode
An elementor pro extension to loop through post types and display shortcode instead of standard predetermined templates.

I do not claim to be an elementor or php whiz, so it is currently ugly as it contains a lot of learning and stabs in the dark.
Anyone who wants to help out would be greatly appreciated.

Process Theory
1) Create Dynamic Tempate of a section or global widget
2) Grab Widget or section shortcode
3) Use elementor posts-shortcode to loop through chosen query and utilize the elementor template to display.
